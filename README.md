# AFL Stats

Simple app that displays AFL player statistics in graphical format. Includes both Disposals and Goals at present.

## Built With

- Vite
- Netlify
  - Functions

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node (see .nvmrc for version)

Running `npm ci && npm run dev` should spin up both the app and a local instance of the Function that scrapes AFL Tables.

## Scripts

### Strip-icons

Basic script that pulls all the individual icons from icons.svg (afl.com.au) as I couldn't get the id references to work.

## Special Thanks

This wouldn't be possible without the ability to scrape [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/), thank you for your page ü§ù.
